# HackLink Hackathon Management System

## Introduction

This Flask-based web application is designed for managing participant registrations for an event. The application provides functionality for adding individual participants manually, uploading participant information via Excel files, and scanning participant QR codes for check-ins.

## Features

1. **Participant Registration:**
   - Participants can be added individually through a user-friendly form.
   - Validation ensures that duplicate entries with the same register number are not allowed.

2. **Excel Upload:**
   - Bulk participant data can be uploaded using an Excel file.
   - The system checks for existing participants and adds new ones accordingly.
   - Asynchronous processing is implemented using Celery to handle large data uploads without affecting the application's responsiveness.

3. **QR Code Generation:**
   - A QR code is generated for each participant upon registration.
   - The QR code is saved as an image in the 'qrcodes' folder.

4. **Email Notification:**
   - After successful registration, participants receive an email with their details and a QR code attachment.
   - Email functionality is integrated using the Mailgun API.

5. **Dashboard:**
   - The dashboard provides an overview of participant statistics, including counts based on gender, accommodation type, and check-ins.

6. **Check-In System:**
   - Participants can be checked in by scanning their QR codes.
   - The system updates the participant's check-in status in the database.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-registration-system.git
   cd flask-registration-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Credentials:**
   - Create a `config.ini` file and provide the necessary credentials, including the Mailgun API key and other configuration details.

4. **Start Celery Worker:**
   ```bash
   celery -A app.celery worker --loglevel=info
   ```
   This command starts a Celery worker that will process background tasks.

5. **Start Flower for Monitoring:**
   ```bash
   celery -A app.celery flower
   ```
   The Flower web-based monitoring tool can be accessed at `http://localhost:5555` by default. It provides insights into task execution and worker status.

   **Note:** Ensure that you have Redis running, as Celery uses it as a message broker.

6. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.
